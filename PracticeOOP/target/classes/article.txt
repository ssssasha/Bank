If not for nature then we wouldnâ€™t be alive. The health benefits of nature for humans are incredible. The most important
thing for survival given by nature is oxygen. The entire cycle of respiration is regulated by nature. The oxygen that we
inhale is given by trees and the carbon dioxide we exhale is getting absorbed by trees.
The ecosystem of nature is a community in which producers (plants), consumers, and decomposers work together in their
environment for survival. The natural fundamental processes like soil creation, photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, and
water cycling, allow Earth to sustain life. We are dependent on these ecosystem services daily whether or not we are
aware.
Nature provides us services round the clock: provisional services, regulating services, and non-material services.
Provisional services include benefits extracted from nature such as food, water, natural fuels and fibres, and medicinal
plants. Regulating services include regulation of natural processes that include decomposition, water purification,
pollution, erosion and flood control, and also, climate regulation. Non-material services are the non-material benefits
that improve the cultural development of humans such as recreation, creative inspiration from interaction with nature
like art, music, architecture, and the influence of ecosystems on local and global cultures.
The interaction between humans and animals, which are a part of nature, alleviates stress, lessens pain and worries.
Nature provides company and gives people a sense of purpose. Studies and research have shown that children especially
have a natural affinity with nature. Regular interaction with nature has boosted health development in children. Nature
supports their physical and mental health and instills abilities to access risks as they grow.
